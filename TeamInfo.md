## Project Summary

SQLMate is a web-based API designed to make querying our structured Music database accessible to non-technical users by abstracting SQL into an intuitive, visual, and no-code query builder. Through a collection of drag-and-drop elements, checkboxes, and other interactive UI components that dynamically reveal related tables based on foreign key relationships, users can construct queries without writing SQL. 

On the backend, SQLMate will use a custom query generation algorithm to convert the UI selections into an SQL query which produces the result that will be sent back to the user. After generating the results, users can download the table/dataset and save it to their account for future modifications and interactions.
